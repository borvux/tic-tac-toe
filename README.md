# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎲

Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## 📋 Requirements

* **Python 3.x**
* **Tkinter:** This library is typically included with standard Python installations.
    * If Tkinter is not available on your system (especially on some Linux distributions), you might need to install it separately. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install python3-tk
        ```
